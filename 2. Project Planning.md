- Setting and reaching milestones and identifying tasks
	1. Milestone
		A. DEF: Important point within project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies completion of deliverable or phase of project
			1. Keep track to make sure project is on schedule to meet goals and on track
			2. must be completed on time and in sequential order
		B. Good to see how much work is involved in the whole project, uncover areas where you might need to adjust
			1. Scope
			2. Timelines
			3. Resources
		C. Setting Milestones
			1. Elavuate project as a whole, refer back to Project Charter
			2. Make list of what needs to happen to achieve goal/project deliverable/phase (smaller items that dont need stakeholder review are tasks)
			3 Dont mistake tasks for milestone, milestone represents moments in time, and in order to map out how you will get to thoes moments, need to assign smaller tasks to each milestone. 
			4. Assigne each milestone a deadline, spaced out. Discuss with teammates the tasks required to reach each milestone and get estimates for how long those tasks will take. and also take into consideration the needs of the stakeholders 
			5. Determin if its Top Down (higher level milestones then works down to break down effort into project tasks) or Bottom Up (looks at all individual tasks and then roll takss into managable chunks that lead to a milestone)
			6. Put milestones and tasks in same place in project plan.
	2. Project task
		A. Activity that needs to be accomplished within set period of time. 
		B. Work Breakdown Stucture WBS
			1. DEF: tool that shorts milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed. 
			2. Tree diagram of project tasks; Milestones at top and then tasks under each milestone.
			3. Start with high level, overarching project picture. Brainstorm to list major deliverables and milestones. 
			4. Idenitify the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet milestones
			5. Examine those tasks and break them down further into sub tasks
		C. Assign tasks to people depending on their role in the proejct.  
			1. Consider teammates workload. 
		E. Assingned tasks should all 
			1. Start with a Verb
			2. Have Assignee 
			3. Due Date
			4. Have details in tasks to avoid miscommunication 
- Project Pan Document 
	1. Create
		A. Scope and Goals
		B. Milestones/Tasks (assigned to teammates)
			1. Work Breakdown Stucture WBS, tasks visible in one place with clear description, owners and due dates.
			2. Sub tasks 
		D. People/Team Roles
		E. Documentation
			1. RACI chart for roles
			2. Project Charter (defines the project and outlines details needed to reach your goals)
			3. Budget
			4. Risk Management plan
		F. Management Plans (overall activities of the project)
			1. Change Managment Plan
			2. Risk Management Plan
			3. Communication Plan
		G. Schedule/Time 
			1. Time estimation: total amount of time required to compete a task
			2. Effort estimation: amout and difficutly of active work required to complete a task
			3. Ask teammates for both estimations, also take into account sub-tasks
			4. Use Buffers to add extra time to end of a task or project to account for unexpected slowdowns or delays in work progress. 
	2. Manage
		A. Capacity Planning
			1. DEF: allocating *people* and *resources* to project tasks, determining whether or not you have necessary resources required to complete work on time. 
			2. Capacity: Amount of work that the people or resources assigned to the project can reasonably complete in a set period of time
			3. Critical Path: List of project milestones you must reach in order to meet the project goal on schedule as well as the mandatory tasks that contribute to the completion of each milestone. tasks on critical path should have zero float.
			4. Measure capacity by looking at the critical path of bare minimum number of tasks and milestones you need to reach your project goal, look at WBS
			5. Identify which tasks can happen in parallel vs which tasks can happen sequentially 
			6. Determine which projects tasks have a fixed start date or an earlier start date
			7. Identify if a task has *float* (also called slack). Float is amout of time you can wait to begin a taks before it impacts project schedule and threatens project outcome. tasks on critical path should have zero float, and tasks that do have Float should not be on the critcal path.
		B. Criticle Path workflow
			1. Capture all tasks, refer to work breakdown structure. 
			2. Set dependencies, (tasks that must be completed before other tasks can start)
			3. Create a network diagram of essential tasks and non essential tasks
			4. Make time estimates (duration of days) by consulting key stakeholders to get accurate time estimates for each tasks. 
			5. Find the critical path by adding up duration (of days) of "essential" taks and calculate longest possible path to determine critical path. Or use Forward Pass (beginning of project tasks add up duration of tasks to end of project) or Backward Pass (start with final task and move backwards thogh scheudle to determine shortest path to completion) to iidentify earliest and latest start dates, or the Slack  
		C. Soft Skills for Time estimation
			1. Asking the right questions, treat is as a interview, how they work on specific tasks
			2. Negotiating effectively
			3. Practicing empathy
	3. Time estimation methods
		A: Buffers:
			1. Task Buffers: used primarly for tasks that are out of the project teams control, use sparingly for tasks within the project teams control for difficult to complete or have element of unpredictability. 
			2. Project Buffers: Add extra time tacked onto the end of a project. 
	4. Tools to build project plan








- Budgeting Process
- Identifying and planning for risks
- Documentation 



- Workflow
	1. Make project charter
	2. Identify major milestones and assign task owners 
		A. Create Work Breakdown Structure WBS diagram and spreadsheet identify and organize major milestones and assign task ownwers. 
		B. Assign due dates and durations and dependencies
	3. Map project schedule and takss using Gantt Chart
	4. Estimate costs and create a budget (one time and recurring expences, and buffer to cover overages)
	5. Create statement of work for Venders
		A. Legal document defines what oyu need from vendor (and what they need from you) so everyone knows whats expected
	6. Risk Management Plan
		A. Assess potential risks to budget and schedule (staffing, shipping)
		B. Identifying, evaluating and preparing for specific risks helps keeps project on track if things go wrong
	7. Create communication plan
		A. Manage communication among stakeholders
		B. Track senders and recipients
		C. Communication Goals
		D. Key dates and other details
	8. Organize project artificats, creat a project plan in central location, so team members and stakeholders can use it to find project docuemtns and for future projects. 
		

Funny Quotes:
"Supportive delegator = boss/manager"
"Planning Fallacy" = underestimate amount of time it will take to complete a task, as well as the costs and risks associated with that task due to optimism bias.
