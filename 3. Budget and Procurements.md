Budgeting
	1. Create and Manage
		A. DEF: Project Budget estimated monetary resources needed to achieve project goals and objective. 
		B. Break budget by milestones/ completion of deliverable or phase of project, list activities and tasks alongside associated costs
			1. Use milestones to re-review budget if anything needs to be reset or revisited 
		C. Forecast DEF: cost estimate over time
		D. Costs, Labor, operating costs and costs for obtaining materials like hardware, software, equipment 
		E. Budget is a success metric, can change over time, but start with a baseline for the budget.
		F. Budget creation takes place in initiation phase of project, but is updated throughout the project, but happens in conjunction with the scheduling process.
		G. Projects that need budget are often to increase workforce productivity, increase revenue and attempt to save costs
		H. Project manager works collaborative with other people on project to create estimates. 
			1. update stakeholders to cost changes
			2. updating forecasts or estimates and track everything
		I. Project manager must show the requested amount of money was used in order to secure enough budget for future projects. 
		J. Creating a project Budget Tips
			1. Historical data of past project management documents
			2. Leverage experts in the field, or other project managers, or vendors for quotes
			3. Bottom-up: thinking of all parts of project from beginning to end, including making a list of every material, resource, contractor worker, anything that comes with associated costs and adding all that together
			4. Confirm accuracy: double check all financial figures to confirm accuracy
			5. Baseline: the initial cost projection of the budget, and then occasional update of budget costs. 
		K. Creating a project Budget Workflow
			1. Break project into tasks 
			2. Estimate Cost of each item, including material costs, misc items, fixed costs, 
			3. Add estimates together, in Planned Costs and Actual Costs, Estimated costs and Final Costs numbers.
			4. Add contingency and tax, buffers and reserves, generally allow buffer of at least 5%
			5. Seek Approval from key stakeholders and get sign off plan and inform them if stakeholders of any changes
	2. Components and Stakeholders
		A. Understand stakeholder needs
		B. Budgeting for surprise expenses
		C. Maintaining adaptability
		D. Reviewing and re forecasting thought the project, or need to create a separate, revised budget  based upon how the project is tracking, or need to create a separate, revised budget  based upon how the project is tracking
		F. Resource cost rates (Labor, tools, equipment, materials and software)
		G. Reserve analysis: methods to check for remaining project resources, and see if you need to add buffer funds
		H. Contingency budget: Money that is included to cover potentially unforeseen events that are not accounted for in a cost estimate
		I. Cost of quality: Costs are incurred to prevent issues with products, processes or tasks
			1. Prevention Costs
			2. Appraisal costs
			3. Internal failure costs
			4. External failure costs
			5. Time-phase your budget: Time-phased budgeting allows you to allocate costs for project tasks over the projected timeline in which those expenses are planned to take place. By looking at your tasks against a timeline, you can track and compare planned versus actual costs over time and manage changes to your budget as necessary.
	3. Procurement
	4. Vendor Management in Agile settings
	5. Legal and Contractual and Ethics
	6. Create own Documentations
