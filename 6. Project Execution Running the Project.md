**Tracking is important**

- Transparency
- Risk Management DEF: process of identifying potential risks and issues which could impact a project and evaluating and applying steps to address the effects of the identified risks and issues
- Keeping the project on track
	1. Project Schedule towards the completion date. 
	2. Status of action items, key tasks and activities
	3. Progress toward milestones
	4. Costs
	5. Key decisions, changes, dependencies and risks to the project
- Tools
	1. GANTT chart, living in project plant
		A. Useful for staying on schedule
		B. Projects with many dependencies, tasks, activities, or milestones
		C. Useful for larger project teams
	2. Roadmap
		A. Best suited for when you need a way to track big milestones in your project
		B. Useful for illustrating how a project should evolve over time to a team and key stakeholders
		C. Contains: Project Goals at top, description of approach to meet goals and main tactics to reach goal, high level project overview which is high level context with 3 sentence summary to state objectives and priorities for project, a table that maps out what the process will entail divided into quarters like Q1 Q2 Q3 etc showing who is responsible for tasks both individual and project progress toward milestones.
	3. Burndown chart 
		A. Useful for projects that require a granular, broken down look at each task, with actual and projected tasks 
		B. Good for launch of projects
	4. ROAM analysis 
		A. Tracks issues by categorizing them as Resolved, owned, accepted or mitigated.  
	5. Escalation standards and practices like Email
		A. To get support and advice from senior stakeholders  
		B. Escalation is healthy, encouraged, used often and celebrated. Can result in speedy decision making, quicker problem is resolved the better off a project will be. 
		C. PM, team, project sponsor should establish escalation standards and practices.  
		D. PM should escalate an issue at first sign of critical problems in a project
			- Cause a delay on a major project milestone

Check in periodically to review with team these. Examples: Reliability Standards, Usability Standards, Product standards, 
		B. Quality Planning: Actions of project manager or team to establish process for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are relevant to the project as a whole. 
			- What outcomes do my customers want?
			- What does quality look like for them?
			- How can I meet their expectations? 
			- How will I determine if the quality measures will lead to project success?
		C. Quality assurance: Evaluating if your project is moving towards delivering a high quality service or product. Do regular check-ins.
		D. Quality Control: Involves monitoring project results and delivery to determine if they are meeting desired results or not.
	2. QA assurance and quality control
	3. Continuous improvement
	4. Data Driven frameworks DMAIC and PDCA
	5. Conduct retrospectives
		A. Should happen thoughout the project, success and setbacks
		B. reason to hold retro: missed deadlines or expectations, miscommunications between stakeholders, reached the end of a sprint, product launches and landings
		C. Record key lessions that other people can learn from

		G.Set clear expectations about when you'll communicate certain things to customers. Like say you will give weekly updates etc. 
		H. Feedback helps you iterate on a product or service
- Risks and Changes
	1. Change DEF: anything that alters or impacts tasks, structures or processes within a project
		A. Triple constraint: budget, resources or timeline
	2. Dependencies DEF: Tasks, activities or milestones that are reliant on one another  
		1. Greatest source of risk to a project
		2. Internal Dependencies DEF: relationship between two tasks within the same project
		3. External dependencies DEF: Tasks that are reliant on outside factors, like regulatory agencies or other projects
		4. Mandatory dependencies: tasks that are legally or contractually required
		5. Discretionary dependencies: defined by project team. Could occurs on their own, but team saw a need to make those dependencies reliant on one another
		6. Dependency management: process of managing interrelated tasks and resources within project to ensure overall project is completed successfully on time and in budget
			- Proper Identification
			- Recording dependencies: Risk Register DEF: should be made to table or chart that contains your list of risks and dependencies. Should include description of dependency, the date, all activities or tasks that may be impacted by the dependency. 
			- Continuous monitoring and control: Schedule regular meetings to check in on the interrelated tasks, stay up to date on any progress being made and double checking for changes that will impact other tasks
			- Efficient communication: 
	3. Change in priorities 
	4. Changes in capacity and people 
	5. Change in budget or resources
	6. Scope Creep
	7. Force Majeure 
- Techniques to manage risk/changes
	1. Refer back to Statement of Work and RACI chart
		1. Who needs to be involved in a change conversation
	2. Change Request form DEF: Create processes for requesting changes for team and organization, like change request form.

		2. Project name:
		3. Discussion Owner:
		4. Discussion Type
		5. Teams involved:
		6. Expected outcome
		7. Target date for discussion
		8. Impacted milestone/goals
		9. Short Description 
		10. In Depth Proposal
		11. Background information
	3. Manage changes and dependencies and scope creep
		1. If dependencies are met on time, team is less likely to fall behind schedule
		2. If scope is tightly managed, your less likely to incur changes to your budget or be for forced to extend your timeline
	4. Make a Risk Register DEF: table or chart that contains your teams lists of risks
		1. Ask team open ended questions, what could improve outcome of the project? Or what could hurt or hinder it? List all them as if/then statements. 
		2. Prioritize risks within risk register, calculate risk exposure DEF: a way to measure potential future loss resulting from specific activity or event by building a inherent risk matrix. Impact along horizontal axis and probability along vertical axis
			- Anything that has high impact on project, even if it has low probability of occurring, make sure to have a mitigation plan in place
	5. ROAM technique after risk arises
		1. Resolved: Consider this risk to be addresses, no longer problem
		2. Owned: Assign team member ownership of risk and monitor risk though completion
		3. Accepted: Understand and accept risk for what it is, because it cant be resolved. 
		4. Mitigated: Formulate plan to eradicate risk, or reduce impact of issue, or reduced likelihood of a risk that has yet to materialize
	6. Mitigation plan is a planned risk response strategy. 
		1. If a project manager is able to identify the potential known risks that impact any of the key project parameters (schedule, cost, or scope), they should make a plan to mitigate those risks early in the project.
- Communication
	1. Small change for one person: send an email, avoid anything discussed in depth, give heads up and set meeting time
	2. Big change more than one person and changes budget, deadline, or scope of project: have team meeting
	3. Timeout DEF: Taking a moment away from project in order to take a breath, regroup and adjust game plan
	4. Retrospectives DEF: Discuss successes, setbacks, possible future improvements. Identifying contributing causes of incident or pattern of incidents without blaming any individual 
	5. Escalation email
		1. Maintain friendly tone
		2. State connection to project
		3. Explain the problem briefly
		4. Explain the consequences: specifics of negative impact
		5. Make a request or propose a course of action
