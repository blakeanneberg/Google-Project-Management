- Quality Management 
	1. Manage quality/meet quality standards
		A. Quality Standards: Requirement, specs or guidelines that can be used to ensure product, processes or services are fit to achieving desired outcome. Set at beginning of the project. Check in periodically to review with team these. Examples: Reliability Standards, Usability Standards, Product standards, 
		B. Quality Planning: Actions of project manager or team to establish process for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are relevant to the project as a whole. 
			- What outcomes do my customers want?
			- What does quality look like for them?
			- How can I meet their expectations? 
			- How will I determine if the quality measures will lead to project success?
		C. Quality assurance: Evaluating if your project is moving towards delivering a high quality service or product. Do regular check-ins.

		G.Set clear expectations about when you'll communicate certain things to customers. Like say you will give weekly updates etc. 
		H. Feedback helps you iterate on a product or service
- Risks and Changes
	1. Change DEF: anything that alters or impacts tasks, structures or processes within a project
		A. Triple constraint: budget, resources or timeline
	2. Dependencies DEF: Tasks, activities or milestones that are reliant on one another  
		1. Greatest source of risk to a project
		2. Internal Dependencies DEF: relationship between two tasks within the same project
		3. External dependencies DEF: Tasks that are reliant on outside factors, like regulatory agencies or other projects
		4. Mandatory dependencies: tasks that are legally or contractually required
		5. Discretionary dependencies: defined by project team. Could occurs on their own, but team saw a need to make those dependencies reliant on one another
		6. Dependency management: process of managing interrelated tasks and resources within project to ensure overall project is completed successfully on time and in budget
			- Proper Identification
			- Recording dependencies: Risk Register DEF: should be made to table or chart that contains your list of risks and dependencies. Should include description of dependency, the date, all activities or tasks that may be impacted by the dependency. 
			- Continuous monitoring and control: Schedule regular meetings to check in on the interrelated tasks, stay up to date on any progress being made and double checking for changes that will impact other tasks
			- Efficient communication: 
	3. Change in priorities 
	4. Changes in capacity and people 
	5. Change in budget or resources
	6. Scope Creep
	7. Force Majeure 
- Techniques to manage risk/changes
	1. Refer back to Statement of Work and RACI chart
		1. Who needs to be involved in a change conversation
	2. Change Request form DEF: Create processes for requesting changes for team and organization, like change request form. 
		1. Title: project plan change summary template 
		2. Project name:
		3. Discussion Owner:
		4. Discussion Type
		5. Teams involved:
		6. Expected outcome
		7. Target date for discussion
		8. Impacted milestone/goals
		9. Short Description 
		10. In Depth Proposal
		11. Background information
	3. Manage changes and dependencies and scope creep
		1. If dependencies are met on time, team is less likely to fall behind schedule
		2. If scope is tightly managed, your less likely to incur changes to your budget or be for forced to extend your timeline
	4. Make a Risk Register DEF: table or chart that contains your teams lists of risks
		1. Ask team open ended questions, what could improve outcome of the project? Or what could hurt or hinder it? List all them as if/then statements. 
		2. Prioritize risks within risk register, calculate risk exposure DEF: a way to measure potential future loss resulting from specific activity or event by building a inherent risk matrix. Impact along horizontal axis and probability along vertical axis
			- Anything that has high impact on project, even if it has low probability of occurring, make sure to have a mitigation plan in place
	5. ROAM technique after risk arises
		1. Resolved: Consider this risk to be addresses, no longer problem
		2. Owned: Assign team member ownership of risk and monitor risk though completion
		3. Accepted: Understand and accept risk for what it is, because it cant be resolved. 
		4. Mitigated: Formulate plan to eradicate risk, or reduce impact of issue, or reduced likelihood of a risk that has yet to materialize
	6. Mitigation plan is a planned risk response strategy. 
		1. If a project manager is able to identify the potential known risks that impact any of the key project parameters (schedule, cost, or scope), they should make a plan to mitigate those risks early in the project.
- Communication
	1. Small change for one person: send an email, avoid anything discussed in depth, give heads up and set meeting time
	2. Big change more than one person and changes budget, deadline, or scope of project: have team meeting
	3. Timeout DEF: Taking a moment away from project in order to take a breath, regroup and adjust game plan
	4. Retrospectives DEF: Discuss successes, setbacks, possible future improvements. Identifying contributing causes of incident or pattern of incidents without blaming any individual 
	5. Escalation email
		1. Maintain friendly tone
		2. State connection to project
		3. Explain the problem briefly
		4. Explain the consequences: specifics of negative impact
		5. Make a request or propose a course of action

		B. Identify which tasks contribute most to overall goal
		C. Prioritize the data or metrics that are most valuable to stakeholders
		D. Stakeholders can look to your project plan for a high-level overview for answers to important questions, determined success criteria, artificats, and overall health of project
		F. Presenting Data to tell project story:
			1. Define your audience, find out what matters most to them, what would my audience like to know about the project? What are their most urgent concerns? Which key data points influence the story and project outcome?
			2. Collect the data to prove the points. leverage project plan or jira.
			3. filter and analyze the data
			4. Choose a visual representation, dashboards that show KPIs, charts, infographics and mappings, summarize project plans and documents and reports. Give percentage of progress of tasks, completd or not started. KPI is a measurable value or metric that demonstrates how effective an organization is at achieving key objectives. KPIs help project teams and stakeholders understand if a project is on the right track. Burndown chart shows time and amount of work outstanding on verticle and time horizontally. InfoGraphic visual representaions or data intended to present info quickly and clearly, usually in a one pager, concise summaries of the data. 
			5. Shape the story: you need to think about what you're hoping to achieve, the points you want to make, and the questions and concerns you want to address. This is when you tie everything together into a cohesive narrative.
			6. Gather feedback before presenting. 
		G. Presentation: 
			1. Be precise: Identify problem your solving for. Remove any content that dilutes your message. Audience should understand visual in 5 seconds or less.  
			2. Be flexible approach youd take if you had to shorten presentation unexpectedly, Practice/prepaire to avoid mistakes that could distract from your message and come up with answers to potential audience questions. If appropriate, send a follow up email with summary notes, action items, and time frames.
			3. Be memorable: 
			4. Accessible: create clear simple slides. Add alt text for images/diagrams. Use text for critical infomation. Provide captions for all audio or video recordings. Contrast and text size, more is better. Share content in advance. 
	4. Data Analysis

		B. Look for repeated behaviours and find solution based on data predictions
		C. Collect data, qualitative (subjective qualities that cant be measured with numerical data) and quantitative (statistical and numerical facts)
		D. Ask:  ask key questions to help frame your analysis, starting with: What is the problem? When defining the problem, look at the current state of the business and identify how it is different from the ideal state. Ask stage is identifying your stakeholders and understanding their expectations.
		E. Prepare: collect and store the data you will use for the upcoming analysis process. 
		F. Process: “clean” your data, which means you will enter your data into a spreadsheet, or another tool of your choice, and eliminate any inconsistencies and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results.  While collecting data, be sure to get rid of any duplicate responses or biased data. 
		G. Analyze: take a close look at your data to draw conclusions, make predictions, and decide on next steps. Create charts or visulizations or graphs
		H. Share: use data visualization to organize your data in a format that is clear and digestible for your audience. When sharing, you can offer the insights you gained during your analysis to help stakeholders make effective, data-driven decisions for solving the problem. Filter info by focusing audience on most important data points and insights, condense long ideas and facts into single image or representation
		I. Act: business takes all of the insights you have provided and puts them into action to solve the original business problem.
