#Agile Project Management

- Projects
	1. Requirements
	2. Documentation
	3. Deliverables
- Waterfall
	1. Linear and sequential

- Agile Project Management
	1. DEF: Flexibility, repetition and openness to change, focus on users
	2. iterations
	3. 4 values
		A. Individuals and interacttions over process and tools
		B. Working software over comprehensive documentation
		C. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
		D. Responding to change over following a plan
	4. Values explained
		A. Work together
		B. Collaborate
		C. Help each other achieve the best outcomes possible
		D. Value individual perspectives and creativiity as important contributions to the success of the project. 
		E. Work on things that create value.
		F. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Collaborate with customers early and often, react and adapt to feedback. 
		G. Acknologe that change is enevital. 
		I. Adapt to changes at any time during the project.
	5. 12 principles, why, how and what
		A. Value Delivery: Delivering work as quickly as possible in order to get feedback and mitigate time risk.
		B. Business Collaboration, value of collaborating to create business value. 
		C. Team Dynamics and Culture
		D. Retrospectives and Continuous Learning

- VUCA Project Management
	1. Defines conductions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world
	2. Volatility: Rate of change and churn in business or situation
	3. Uncertainty: Lack of predicability or high potential for surprise 
	4. Complexity: High number of interrelated forces, issues, organizations, and factors that would influence the project
	5. Ambiguity: Possibility of misunderstanding he conditions and root causes of events or circumstances. 	

- Scrum 
	1. Product Backlog
		A. Central artifact in scrum
		B. Where all possible ideas deliverables, features or tasks are captured for the team to work on
        C. Authoritive source for things that teams work on. Contains features, requirements and activities associated with deliverables to achieve the goal of the project.
        D. Description: really clear, details
        E. Value: how much value it delivers to the customer. small amout of money to large amount of $$$$
        F. Order: Pritority 1-100 ect. 
        G. Estimate: Owned by the dev team. How much effort it will take to get it complete. Low, Medium, High.
        H. User stories: short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user, "as a <user role> I want this <action> so that I can get this Mvalue>. Product Owner writes the user stori. Product Owner writes the user stories
            - Independent, story stared and finished by itself
            - Negotiable
            - Valuable has to add value to the project
            - Estimable estimation of done must be clrear
            - Small (must fit within the sprint)
            - Testable
        I: Epic: a group of user stories
        J: Relative estimation: instead of trying to determine exactly how long a task will take, we compare the effort of that task to another task, and that becomes the estimate. T-Shrit sizes (choose a medium size, and then find another item and see what that size is compaired to the medium) and Story Points (pick a anchor item, then use fibonacci sequeince, to estimate ask size for, example is fruit with straberry being easy but pineapple is complex). 
        K: Backlog refinement: up to team to go over backlog. 
	3. Sprint / Iteration
		A. A time boxed iteration in Scrum where work is done. recommened duration for Scrum events. Create sense of urgency, help the team pace their work and provide a window of focus for the team.
        B. No changes made hat would endanger the sprin goal.
        C. Quality does not decrease.
        D. Product backlog is refined as needed
        E. Scope may be clarified and renogotiated with product owner as more is learned.
        F. C. What improvements were put in place for the last sprint, were they helpful or not?Sprints enable predictabiliy by ensureing nspection and adaption of progress toward a Product Goal at least every calander month. 
        G. Forcast sprints with Burn downs, burn ups, cumulative flows.
        H. Sprint Planning: entire scrum team comes together and emets to confirm how much capacity/people are available during the sprint.
	5. Daily Scrum
		A. Meeting of 15 or fewer minutes every day of the sprint
        B. Ask: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Do I notie any impediment? 
        E. One week sprint. Meet two times per week.

		B. Responsible for the invintory of work and the final say on how to prioritize the work
	9. Development team
        A. Responsible for how the team will deliver that product, 3 to 9 peoppel
        B. Crossfunctional

       A. Designing 
       B. Coding: XP demands clear and concise code so that others can easily read and understand the program.

       B. Listing: 
    2. XP innovative practices
        A. Pair programming
        B. continous integration and continous refactoring: merging product changes into a shared 
        C. avoid big design up front: design is just enough to get started and should be continously improved as product evolves

-Lean
    1. Define value: identify and focus on what customer wants and include the customer
    2. Map value stream: map out the steps to production and challenge all wasted steps
    3. Create flow: ensure product flows though the value stream efficiently, eliminating waste though the cycle. 
    5. Establish pull: ensure the customer is pulling on the product though this stream by asking for features and incremental deliveries.
    6. Puresue perfectio
