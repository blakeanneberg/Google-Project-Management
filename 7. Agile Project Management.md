		F. Order: Pritority 1-100 ect. 
		G. Estimate: Owned by the dev team. How much effort it will take to get it complete. Low, Medium, High.
		H. User stories: short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user, "as a <user role> I want this <action> so that I can get this Mvalue>. Product Owner writes the user stori. Product Owner writes the user storiess
			- Independent, story stared and finished by itself
			- Negotiable
			- Valuable has to add value to the project
			- Estimable estimation of done must be clrear
			- Small (must fit within the sprint)
			- Testable 
		I: Epic: a group of user stories
		J: Relative estimation: instead of trying to determine exactly how long a task will take, we compare the effort of that task to another task, and that becomes the estimate. T-Shrit sizes (choose a medium size, and then find another item and see what that size is compaired to the medium) and Story Points (pick a anchor item, then use fibonacci sequeince, to estimate ask size for, example is fruit with straberry being easy but pineapple is complex).
