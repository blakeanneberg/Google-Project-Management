#Agile Project Management

- Projects
	1. Requirements
	2. Documentation
	3. Deliverables
- Waterfall
	1. Linear and sequential

- Agile Project Management

	2. iterations
	3. 4 values
		A. Individuals and interacttions over process and tools
		B. Working software over comprehensive documentation
		C. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

- VUCA Project Management
	1. Defines conductions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world
	2. Volatility: Rate of change and churn in business or situation
	3. Uncertainty: Lack of predicability or high potential for surprise 
	4. Complexity: High number of interrelated forces, issues, organizations, and factors that would influence the project
	5. Ambiguity: Possibility of misunderstanding he conditions and root causes of events or circumstances. 	

- Scrum 
	1. Product Backlog
		A. Central artifact in scrum
		B. Where all possible ideas deliverables, features or tasks are captured for the team to work on
        C. Authoritive source for things that teams work on. Contains features, requirements and activities associated with deliverables to achieve the goal of the project.
        D. Description: really clear, details
        E. Value: how much value it delivers to the customer. small amout of money to large amount of $$$$
        F. Order: Pritority 1-100 ect. 
        G. Estimate: Owned by the dev team. How much effort it will take to get it complete. Low, Medium, High.
        H. User stories: short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user, "as a <user role> I want this <action> so that I can get this Mvalue>. Product Owner writes the user stori. Product Owner writes the user stories
            - Independent, story stared and finished by itself
            - Negotiable
            - Valuable has to add value to the project
            - Estimable estimation of done must be clrear
            - Small (must fit within the sprint)
            - Testable
        I: Epic: a group of user stories
        J: Relative estimation: instead of trying to determine exactly how long a task will take, we compare the effort of that task to another task, and that becomes the estimate. T-Shrit sizes (choose a medium size, and then find another item and see what that size is compaired to the medium) and Story Points (pick a anchor item, then use fibonacci sequeince, to estimate ask size for, example is fruit with straberry being easy but pineapple is complex). 
        K: Backlog refinement: up to team to go over backlog. 
	2. Sprint / Iteration
		A. A time boxed iteration in Scrum where work is done. recommened duration for Scrum events. Create sense of urgency, help the team pace their work and provide a window of focus for the team.
        B. No changes made hat would endanger the sprin goal.
        C. Quality does not decrease.
        D. Product backlog is refined as needed
        E. Scope may be clarified and renogotiated with product owner as more is learned.
        F. C. What improvements were put in place for the last sprint, were they helpful or not?Sprints enable predictabiliy by ensureing nspection and adaption of progress toward a Product Goal at least every calander month. 
        G. Forcast sprints with Burn downs, burn ups, cumulative flows.
        H. Sprint Planning: entire scrum team comes together and emets to confirm how much capacity/people are available during the sprint.
        I. Velocity: the measure how many points the team burns down in a given sprint. can determin how long it can take to complete entire product backlog and how much of backlog will be completed by a particular time. 
	4. Daily Scrum

-Lean
    1. Define value: identify and focus on what customer wants and include the customer
    2. Map value stream: map out the steps to production and challenge all wasted steps
    3. Create flow: ensure product flows though the value stream efficiently, eliminating waste though the cycle. 
    5. Establish pull: ensure the customer is pulling on the product though this stream by asking for features and incremental deliveries.
    6. Puresue perfectio



## Agile and Scrum in real world ## 
- Case [Studies](Studies)
    1. When reading case studies, focus on the problem, the effect it had on the business or organization, and the pros and cons of the solutions reached to help you determine some applicable key takeaways.
    2. What is the issue?
    3. What is the goal of the analysis?
    4. What is the context of the problem?
    5. What key facts should be considered?
    6. What alternatives are available to the decision-maker?
    7. What would you recommend, and why?
    8.  
- Value diven delivery
- Value road map
    1. Roadmap where to go, how to get there 
    2. mapping out product development process
    3. can be used for all kinds of businesses 
    4. guide that demonstrates 
        - where to go
        - how to get there
        - what to accomplish along the way
    5. helps the team explain the vision of the product
    6. Product Vision
        - What the product is
        - How it supports the customers business strategy
        - Who will use it
    8. Product Roadmap
        - High level view of the expected product and its requirements
        - Estimated schedule for reaching milestones
    10. Release Plans
        - Realse goal of features you plan to include in the release
        - List of backlog items, epics, user stories and info for the release
        - estimated release date, product owner and project manager/scrum master must work together. Need to connect the product roadmap with the teams capacity and velocity, factors that can change a release plan, team velocity changes, changes to product scope, improving the understanding of how much effort is needed to build certain things. 
        - other relevant dates that impact a release
        - Scrum master or project mamager should always review release plan before starting a sprint planning session.
        - Changes to plans: Identify a needed change, deciding to make the change, implementing the change by looking at the triple constraint of scope, time and costs/resources. 
- Facilitating organizational change
    1. understanding organizational culture and change management process is crucial when intrducing new ways of working. Change takes patient persistance.
    2. Create ownership and urgency 
        - Find executive sponsor who also feels a sense of ownership for change your creating
        - Ask questions about whats working and whats not working right now. 
        - What is preventing us from providing the best possible product to our customers?
        - What is allowing our competitors to outperform us in the market? 
        - How can we help our teams become more productive and supported in their work?
    3. Ways to influence: 
        - Clairify measureable results
        - Find vital behaviours, evalutaate which behaviours are constructive to the change you wish to promote and notice examples of those who succeed where most others fail
