		B. Measurable
		C. Attainable
		D. Relevant: Time Bound
	7. OKR's
		A. Objectives and Key Results
		B. A goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome
		C. Benchmarking: to make a goal measurable, research how others in industry quantify success. Which refers to evaluating success against a standard.
	9. Scope
		A. Boundaries of project, whats needed to achieve project goals
		B. Stakeholders who read the project important to get consensus on critical elements of project details  
		C. Questions: Which project details are your stakeholders aligned on that would be considered in scope? Do stakeholders disagree on any elements? Any details you should designate as out of scope for particular project
	10. Benefits
		A. Gains of project, direct monetary gains or indirect benefits
		B. Benefits also found in the business case or project proposal
		C. List of benefits can help identify potential project goals I might have missed.
	11. Costs

		D. Listing out costs via cost estimates, benefits should outweighs the costs

## Project Charter Tasks and Milestones
	1. Define project tasks in one or two sentences. If longer that means task is complex and could be broken down in to smaller tasks 
	2. Look at project task dependencies. 
	3. Enlist help from team members
	4. Define project tasks by amount of time they will complete, will reveal any lengthy tasks. Identify tasks by time helps determine appropriate milestones. Identify project tasks by their done factor. Work backwards from what is considered for a task to be "done" to see if you have missed any steps and identify checkpoints for completion. 

- Time Estimates
	1. Asking right questions 
		A. Check experts understanding of task and ask them to explain detailed steps involved 
		B. Ask estimates of sub steps and comparing them to the experts estimate of total time needed. 
		C. Discussing assumptions the expert might be making and considering their impact on the estimates
		d. Clarifying difference between effort estimates and total duration estimates 
		D. Comparing experts estimations to actual time spent on similar tasks in previous work.
	2. Three Point Estimate scenarios
		A. Optimistic: issues will not occur and task will be completed within estimated time
		B. Most Likely: Some issues will occurs and is based on how long the task usually takes under normal circumstances
		C. Pessimistic: Assumes worst case scenario, issues will occur
		D. Each one shows amount of time a task will take under that category
		E. Final estimate: examine best and worst case scenario timing. Compare with most likely Scenario. Build buffer that accounts for risks that are likely but still keeps project progressing at an efficient rate. 
		F. Triangular Distribution Equation:  " E= (Optimistic + Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 3 " 
		G. Beta PERT Distribution: " E= (Optimistic + 4(Most Likely) + Pessimistic) /6
	3. Applying confidence level ratings
		A. Helps identify whether you should ask project team for input
		B. Use a three point technique
		C. Poll your team, get a percentage for how confident they are
		D. Define categories, like never done project, don't this handful of times, done it a ton of times
	4. Time estimation negotiation
		A. Say "no" without saying "no" by asking open ended questions: "how would like me to proceed?" or "How can we solve this problem?" or "What can I do to help?"
		B. Focus on interests, not positions: identify the other persons needs, wants and motivations around completing a certain task. 
		C. Present mutually beneficial options
		D. Insist on objective criteria: base criteria on neutral info like market value, research findings, previously documented experience and laws and regulations. Agree in advance about which objective criteria to consult and then use that info to determine estimates
	5. Empathy
		A. Listen with curiosity
		B. Repeat what you think I heard
		C. Connect with their experience 
		D. Recognize judgements
		E. Recognizing buffering, ask them upfront if they have added a buffer for weekends, holidays, sickness emergencies. 
		F. Focus on what the other person is saying, avoid distractions.

		C. What their priorities are

		E. Hot to prioritize particular stakeholder needs and goals
		F. Keep project vision clear, project vision describes the need the project is fulfilling. Its important to have clear, specific project vision because stakeholders may apply pressure to increase the requirements, shorten the timeline or cut resources. Ensure stakeholders agreed upon what "Done" nooks like. Provides clarity for everyone involved with the project. Including highly influential stakeholders in the strategic planning process will make sure that all team members are aligned with project vision.
		G. Equip stakeholders with user friendly resources at all times. One pager, weekly status report with latest info and links to main project artifacts. 
		H. Enlist help of senior stakeholders when necessary.
	3. Tools
		A. Power interest grid
