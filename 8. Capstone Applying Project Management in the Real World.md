## Project Charter Tasks and Milestones
	1. Define project tasks in one or two sentences. If longer that means task is complex and could be broken down in to smaller tasks 
	2. Look at project task dependencies. 
	3. Enlist help from team members
	4. Define project tasks by amount of time they will complete, will reveal any lengthy tasks. Identify tasks by time helps determine appropriate milestones. Identify project tasks by their done factor. Work backwards from what is considered for a task to be "done" to see if you have missed any steps and identify checkpoints for completion. 

- Time Estimates

		C. Pessimistic: Assumes worst case scenario, issues will occur
		D. Each one shows amount of time a task will take under that category
		E. Final estimate: examine best and worst case scenario timing. Compare with most likely Scenario. Build buffer that accounts for risks that are likely but still keeps project progressing at an efficient rate. 
		F. Triangular Distribution Equation:  " E= (Optimistic + Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 3 " 
		G. Beta PERT Distribution: " E= (Optimistic + 4(Most Likely) + Pessimistic) /6
	3. Applying confidence level ratings

		B. Use a three point technique
		C. Poll your team, get a percentage for how confident they are
		D. Define categories, like never done project, don't this handful of times, done it a ton of times
	4. Time estimation negotiation
		A. Say "no" without saying "no" by asking open ended questions: "how would like me to proceed?" or "How can we solve this problem?" or "What can I do to help?"
		B. Focus on interests, not positions: identify the other persons needs, wants and motivations around completing a certain task. 
		C. Present mutually beneficial options
		D. Insist on objective criteria: base criteria on neutral info like market value, research findings, previously documented experience and laws and regulations. Agree in advance about which objective criteria to consult and then use that info to determine estimates
	5. Empathy

		B. Repeat what you think I heard
		C. Connect with their experience

Including highly influential stakeholders in the strategic planning process will make sure that all team members are aligned with project vision.
