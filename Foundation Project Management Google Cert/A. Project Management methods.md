**Six Sigma

- Finds aspects of product or process that are measurable like time, cost or quantity. Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet six sigma standard. Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon
- Process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.
1. Always focus on the customer.
2. Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
3. Make your processes flow smoothly.
4. Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
5. Stop defects by removing variation.
6. Involve and collaborate with your team.
7. Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.

Lean Six Sigma
- Kanban and 5S build quality in processes from beginning
- Products developed using Lean methods are then inspected or tested using Six Sigma standards. Products that do not meet these standards are rejected. 
- Differenct is that Lean streamlines processes while Six Sigma reduces variation in products by building in quality from beginning and inspecting products to ensure quality standards are met
