- Risk
	1. Def: Potential event which can occure and can impact your project
	2. Types of risks
		A. Time risks: possibility that project tasks will take longer than anticipated to complete
		B. Budget risks
		C. Scope risks
- Issues
	1. Known or real problem that can affect ability to complete task
- Risk Management
	1. Process of identifying and evaluating potential risks and issues that could impact a project
		A. What could go wrong
		B. Who youll need to consult
		C. How the risk could be mitigated
	2. How to identify phases
		A. Identify the risk, define it
		B. Analyze the risk, determin likelihood and impact
		C. Evaluate the risk, use results of risk anaylsis to determine which risk to prioitize
		D. Treat the risk, make plan for how to treat and manage each risk, serious risks need detailed mitigation plans
		E. Monitor and control the risk, assign team membbers to monitor, track, mitigate risks 
	3. Tools
		A. Brainstorming: Use RACI matrix chart on who to invite, and invite multiple people who are diverse.
		B. Cause and effect diagram, fish bone diagram: shows possible causes of an event or risk
			1. Define the problem
			2. Define the categories: like Technology, maerials, people etc
			3. Brainstorm the causes: identify possible causes, brainstorm 
			4. Analyze the causes: need to identify root cause existing problem to mitigate, cross out causes that might not be root cause issues
		C. Document risks in a Risk Register: a table or chart that contains a list of risks
		D. Risk assessment: stage of risk management where qualities of a risk are estimated or measured
		E: Risk register: spreadsheet of all risks
		F: Probability and impact matrix: a tool used to prioritize project risk
		G: Impact and probability: damage/probability a risk could cause, if it occures. Determined on a scale of high, medium an dlow. Medium and high risks are what you should plan around. 
- Opportunity from risk
	1. use brainstorming and drawing on project history or experence, identify opportunities and outline how you will take advantage of them if they occure.  
	2. Exploit, eliminate uncertainty
	3. Share, allocate ownership
	4. Enhance, modify exposure
	5. Ignore, include in baseline
