- Risk
	1. Def: Potential event which can occure and can impact your project
	2. Types of risks
		A. Time risks: possibility that project tasks will take longer than anticipated to complete
		B. Budget risks: Possiblity that the cost of a project will increawe due to poor planning or expnding projects scope.
		C. Scope risks: Project wont produce results outlined in project goals. deliverables of project might not be acceptable to stakeholders or customers and that may defeat purpose of entire project
		D: External risk: risks from outside the company 
		E: Single point of failure: will stop all project
		F: Dependency risk: Dependencies link connect one project to another, often huge source of risk to a project. Plan for dependencies to avoid risk.
			1. Internal: Dependencies within project that you and your team have control over
			2. External: Dependencies that you have no control over
			3. Finish to Start: 'Task B cant start until Task A has finished'
			4. Finish to Finish: 'Task A must finish before Task B can finish'
			5. Start to Start: 'Task B cant start until Task A has started'
			6. Start to finish: 'Task B cant finish until Task A has started'
			7. Dependency Graphs: Use dependencies to visually represent the flow of work during the project, and be able to identify any risk associated with them.

- Issues
	1. Known or real problem that can affect ability to complete task
- Risk Management
	1. Process of identifying and evaluating potential risks and issues that could impact a project
		A. What could go wrong
		B. Who youll need to consult
		C. How the risk could be mitigated
	2. How to identify phases
		A. Identify the risk, define it
		B. Analyze the risk, determin likelihood and impact
		C. Evaluate the risk, use results of risk anaylsis to determine which risk to prioitize
		D. Treat the risk, make plan for how to treat and manage each risk, serious risks need detailed mitigation plans
			1. Avoid the risk: 
			2. Minimize the risk: use a decision tree, to view impact of decision on whole pproject.  
			3. Transfer the risk: 
			4. Accept the risk: Acitve acceptance is setting aside extra funds to pay your way out of trouble. 
		E. Monitor and control the risk, assign team membbers to monitor, track, mitigate risks 
	3. Tools
		A. Brainstorming: Use RACI matrix chart on who to invite, and invite multiple people who are diverse.
		B. Cause and effect diagram, fish bone diagram: shows possible causes of an event or risk
			1. Define the problem
			2. Define the categories: like Technology, maerials, people etc
			3. Brainstorm the causes: identify possible causes, brainstorm 
			4. Analyze the causes: need to identify root cause existing problem to mitigate, cross out causes that might not be root cause issues
		C. Document risks in a Risk Register: a table or chart that contains a list of risks
		D. Risk assessment: stage of risk management where qualities of a risk are estimated or measured
		E: Risk register: spreadsheet of all risks
		F: Probability and impact matrix: a tool used to prioritize project risk
		G: Impact and probability: damage/probability a risk could cause, if it occures. Determined on a scale of high, medium an dlow. Medium and high risks are what you should plan around. 
		H. Risk management plan: 
			1. DEF: living document that contains info regarding high level risks and mitigation plans for those risks, update it to add new risks, remove risks, and any changes in mitigation plan used to assess risk
			2. Name of company
			3. Auther name: 
			4. Status: Final/draft
			5. Created/Updates: 
			6. Objective: "Objectvie of this docuemnt is to outline risks to X and the plans to mitagate those risks".
			7. Execuitive Summary: Brief intorduction to normal conditions of a project and outline potential risks that could impact the project
			8. Risks and how to mitigate: Include risk table/chart that says risk description, risk to project, and mitigation plan.
			9. Appendix: impact chart of the types of impact (financial, operational, reputational), and Low, Medium, High
	4. Communicating Risks to Stakeholders
		1. Depends on severity of risks
			A. Low level risks: weekly planning emails, address how they will be delt with if they arrise
			B. Medium level risk: Direct email between you and stakeholder, outline riks with more specifics and provide detailed explanation of plan to mitigate risk. Link to risk management plan to provide them with info. write 'Urgent' in subject line. 
			C. High level risks: Need to be talked about in meeting with Project Plan. Get feedback on risk managemnt plan, ask for insights. 


- Opportunity from risk
	1. use brainstorming and drawing on project history or experence, identify opportunities and outline how you will take advantage of them if they occure.  
	2. Exploit, eliminate uncertainty
	3. Share, allocate ownership
	4. Enhance, modify exposure
	5. Ignore, include in baseline
