					- (G-C) / C = ROI 
						- G: Financial gains expected from the project
						- C: Upfront and ongoing costs of the project
						- See: https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/cost-benefit-analysis-for-projects-a-step-by-step-guide
						- 
			- Benefits
				- What value will this project create?
				- How much money could this project save our org?
				- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
				- How much time will be saved?
				- How will the user experience be improved?
			-  Intangible benefits/Costs examples
				- Customer Satisfaction
				- Employee Satisfaction
				- Employee productivity
				- Brand Perception
			- Costs
				- How much time will people have to spend on this project?
				- What will be the one-time costs?
				- Are there any ongoing costs?
				- What about long-term costs?
	- Determining resources
	- Clearly documenting key components of a project
