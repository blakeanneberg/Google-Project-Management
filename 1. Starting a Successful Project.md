	- Resources
		- Prevents from going overbudget
	- Asking stakeholders the right questions
		- What does success look like?
		- Timeline?
	- Performing research
		- Cost benefit analysis (adding up expected value of the project and comparing them to the dollar costs).
			- Benefits should always outweigh the costs.
				- Calculating Return on Investment:
					- Compare upfront and ongoing costs over time
					- (G-C) / C = ROI 
						- G: Financial gains expected from the project
						- C: Upfront and ongoing costs of the project
						- See: https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/cost-benefit-analysis-for-projects-a-step-by-step-guide
						- 
			- Benefits
				- What value will this project create?
				- How much money could this project save our org?
				- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
				- How much time will be saved?
				- How will the user experience be improved?
			-  Intangible benefits/Costs examples
				- Customer Satisfaction
				- Employee Satisfaction
				- Employee productivity
				- Brand Perception
			- Costs
				- How much time will people have to spend on this project?
				- What will be the one-time costs?
				- Are there any ongoing costs?
				- What about long-term costs?
	- Determining resources
	- Clearly documenting key components of a project

**Identifying project scope, goals, deliverables
1. Goals
	1. DEF: What you have been asked to do and what your trying to achieve. 
	2. TIP: Do active listening. meetings with people to understand the landscape.
	3. Create and evaluate goals via SMART goals:
		1. Specific (requirements and constraints)
			1. What do I want to Accomplish?
			2. Why is this a Goal?
			3. Who is Involved?
			4. Where should the goal be delivered
			5. To What Degree?
		2. Measurable (allows people to stay motivated)
			1. How much?
			2. How many?
			3. How will I know when its accomplished?
			4. Metrics? Numbers or figures.
			5. Benchmarks? Points of reference, allows you to compare. Like last year vs this year.
		3. Attainable
			1. Can it reasonably be reached?
			2. How can it be accomplished?
		4. Relevant 
			1. Does the goal make sense?
			2. Is the goal worthwhile? Match clients goal?
			3. Timing?
		5. Time Bound
			1. Deadline to track progress.
			2. Time and metrics, allows you to show how much you need to do over time.
	4. Objectives  and Key Results OKR's
		1. Goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome to further clarify the deliverables  needed from project to accomplish goals
			1. document  OKRs and link to them in your project plan.
		2. Objective:
			1. Defines what needs to be achieved and describes a desired outcome
				1. Aspirational, aligned with organizational goals, action-oriented, concrete, and significant and motivational.
				2. Consider the vision you and your stakeholders have for your project
				3. Determine what you want the project team to accomplish in 3–6 months.
			3. Example: Improve customer retention

				1. Does objective help in achieving project's overall goals?
				2. Does objective align with company and departmental OKRs?
				3. Is the objective inspiring and motivational?
				4. Will achieving objective make significant impact?
		3. Key Results:
			1. *Measurable outcomes* that define when objective is met, describe how you’ll know you did it. 
				1. Add 2–3 key results for each objective. Results-oriented—not a task.
				2. Key results should be time-bound.
				3. Measurable, specific and verifiable within a shorter period or to define whether you’ve met your objective at the end of the project.
				4. Ambitious: Make KR hard and not easy to push everyone
				5. Define success for the Objective
			2. Example: Achieve a 90% customer satisfaction rating by the end of the first quarter
			3. Question: 
				1. What does success mean?
				2. What metrics would prove that we have successfully achieved the objective?
		4. OKR Levels
			1. Company / Organization

				3. Help motivate your team since OKRs are intended to challenge you to push past what’s easily achievable
				4. Set in Initiation phase
				5. Tracked though execution stages to measure project success
				6. Support company and department level OKRs
	5. Stretch Goals
		1. Challenge yourself to do something we haven't accomplished before
2. Scope

	3. Tangible outcomes.
	4. Help quantify and realize the impact of the project
	5. Examples: 
		1. #ProjectCharter itself
		2. Product Features
		3. Functionalities 
		4. Documentation
		5. Processes 
4. Success criteria
	1. DEF: Standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching its goals.
  2. Clear goal, well defined. Goal should tell you what your trying to achieve. Specific and measurable.

**Identifying stakeholders


**Scoping project tools and resources
- #ProjectCharter
	- After identifying Goals, Scope, Deliverables, Success Criteria, Stakeholders and Resources are identified. 
	- DEF: Document that clearly defines the project and its goals, outlines what is needed to accomplish them. All the details of the project.
