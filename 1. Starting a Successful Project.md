**Initiating the project
- Begins after a problem or opportunity has been identified within an organization
	- Senior leaders at a company will initiate for the specific need for the business
- Project Manager tasks on initial discussions of the project
	- Goals (solidify scope of the project.)
	- Resources
		- Prevents from going overbudget
	- Asking stakeholders the right questions
		- What does success look like?
		- Timeline?
	- Performing research
		- Cost benefit analysis (adding up expected value of the project and comparing them to the dollar costs).
			- Benefits should always outweigh the costs.
				- Calculating Return on Investment:
					- Compare upfront and ongoing costs over time
					- (G-C) / C = ROI 
						- G: Financial gains expected from the project
						- C: Upfront and ongoing costs of the project
						- See: https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/cost-benefit-analysis-for-projects-a-step-by-step-guide
						- 
			- Benefits
				- What value will this project create?
				- How much money could this project save our org?
				- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
				- How much time will be saved?
				- How will the user experience be improved?
			-  Intangible benefits/Costs examples
				- Customer Satisfaction
				- Employee Satisfaction
				- Employee productivity
				- Brand Perception
			- Costs
				- How much time will people have to spend on this project?
				- What will be the one-time costs?
				- Are there any ongoing costs?
				- What about long-term costs?
	- Determining resources
	- Clearly documenting key components of a project

**Identifying project scope, goals, deliverables in the Initial Planning Stage
1. Goals
	1. DEF: What you have been asked to do and what your trying to achieve. 
	2. TIP: Do active listening. meetings with people to understand the landscape.
	3. Create and evaluate goals via SMART goals:
		1. Specific (requirements and constraints)
			1. What do I want to Accomplish?
			2. Why is this a Goal?
			3. Who is Involved?
			4. Where should the goal be delivered
			5. To What Degree?
		2. Measurable (allows people to stay motivated)
			1. How much?
			2. How many?
			3. How will I know when its accomplished?
			4. Metrics? Numbers or figures.
			5. Benchmarks? Points of reference, allows you to compare. Like last year vs this year.
		3. Attainable
			1. Can it reasonably be reached?
			2. How can it be accomplished?
		4. Relevant 
			1. Does the goal make sense?
			2. Is the goal worthwhile? Match clients goal?
			3. Timing?
		5. Time Bound
			1. Deadline to track progress.
			2. Time and metrics, allows you to show how much you need to do over time.
	4. Objectives  and Key Results OKR's
		1. Goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome to further clarify the deliverables  needed from project to accomplish goals
			1. document  OKRs and link to them in your project plan.
		2. Objective:
			1. Defines what needs to be achieved and describes a desired outcome
				1. Aspirational, aligned with organizational goals, action-oriented, concrete, and significant and motivational.
				2. Consider the vision you and your stakeholders have for your project
				3. Determine what you want the project team to accomplish in 3–6 months.
			3. Example: Improve customer retention
			4. Questions:
				1. Does objective help in achieving project's overall goals?
				2. Does objective align with company and departmental OKRs?
				3. Is the objective inspiring and motivational?
				4. Will achieving objective make significant impact?
		3. Key Results:
			1. *Measurable outcomes* that define when objective is met, describe how you’ll know you did it. 
				1. Add 2–3 key results for each objective. Results-oriented—not a task.
				2. Key results should be time-bound.
				3. Measurable, specific and verifiable within a shorter period or to define whether you’ve met your objective at the end of the project.
				4. Ambitious: Make KR hard and not easy to push everyone
				5. Define success for the Objective
			2. Example: Achieve a 90% customer satisfaction rating by the end of the first quarter
			3. Question: 
				1. What does success mean?
				2. What metrics would prove that we have successfully achieved the objective?
		4. OKR Levels
			1. Company / Organization
				1. OKR's shared around org to make sure everyone is clear on company goals
				2. High-level OKR's support mission of the organization.
			2. Department / Team
			3. Project
				1. Support and aligned with company level OKR's and define measurable project goals
				2. Establish the appropriate scope for your team so that you can say “no” to requests that may get in the way of them meeting their objectives.
				3. Help motivate your team since OKRs are intended to challenge you to push past what’s easily achievable
				4. Set in Initiation phase
				5. Tracked though execution stages to measure project success
				6. Support company and department level OKRs
	5. Stretch Goals
		1. Challenge yourself to do something we haven't accomplished before
2. #Scope 
	1. DEF: Process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the project.
	2. Define Project Boundaries: 
		1. Knowing exactly who the project delivered to and who will be using the end result
		2. Know project's complexity
		3. Timeline
		4. Budget 
		5. Resources 
	3. How? Asking scope-defining questions to sponsors and stakeholders, understand their goals are, and find to what is and what is not included in the project. 
		1. Stakeholders WHO:
			1. How did you arrive at the decision to update X?
			2. Did the request originate from the restaurant owner, customers, or other stakeholders?
		2. Goals WHAT:
			1. What is the reason for updating x?
			2. What is'nt working in the current x?
			3. What is the end goal of X?
		3. Deliverables WHY:
			1. Which x is being updated?
			2. What exactly needs to be updated?
			3. Does the X need Y?
		4. Resources WHAT:
			1. What Materials, Equipment, people will be needed?
			2. Will we need to hire contractors?
			3. Wil we need to attain X and Y?
		5. Budget WHAT:
			1. What is the budget for this project? is it fixed or flexible?
		6. Schedule WHEN: 
			1. How much time do we have to complete the project?
			2. When does the project need to be completed?
		8. Flexibility HOW:
			1. How much flexibility is there?
			2. What is the highest proiority: hitting deadline, sticking to budget or making sure the result meets all quality targets?
		9. Where did this project come from?
		10. Why is it needed?
		11. What is the project expected to achieve?
		12. What does the project sponsor have in mind?
		13. Who approves the final result?
	5. Scope early on so you can get everyone with same set of expectations
		1. Document all details so anyone can refer back to it though whole lifecycle of project.
		2. Out of scope are tasks that are not included in project plan and don't contribute to projects goal
		3. Scope creep are changes, growth, uncontrolled factors that affect projects scope at any point after the project begins (not before it starts)
			1. External:
				1. Make sure stakeholders have visibility into what is going to be produced, what resources are required, how much it will cost, how much time it will take
				2. Get clarity on project requirements, ask for constructive criticism of initial product proposal, get info before contracts are signed
				3. Set ground rules and expectations for stakeholder involvement like rules and responsibilities. 
				4. Create plan for dealing with out of scope requests
				5. Put your agreements in writing 
			2. Internal:
				1. Members of product team
					1. Product improvement
					2. Process changes
				2. Any changes outside of project scope comes off the bottom line, threatens the schedule, and increases risk
				3. There are no small impacts of project scope, any time a team member takes on an unplanned task, more is lost than just time spent
			3. Best defence is knowing project in and out and always be prepared with the most appropriate response to new idea or request.
				1. Define projects requirements
				2. set clear project schedule
				3. determine what is out of scope
				4. provide alternatives
				5. set up change control process
				6. learn how to say no
				7. collect costs for out of scope work
				8. 
3. (Project) Deliverables
	1. DEF: Products and services that you will create for your customer, client or project sponsor
	2. Deliverables are submitted to help reach project goals, what gets produced or presented at the end of a task, even or process
	3. Tangible outcomes.
	4. Help quantify and realize the impact of the project
	5. Examples: 
		1. #ProjectCharter itself
		2. Product Features
		3. Functionalities 
		4. Documentation
		5. Processes 
4. Success criteria
	1. DEF: Standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching its goals.
	2. Clear goal, well defined. Goal should tell you what your trying to achieve. Specific and measurable. 
	3. Goal also tells you how to do what you have been asked to do. 
	4. Other information in goal like % percentage will help. Get more info from stakeholders. 
5. Stakeholders
	1. DEF: People who both have an interest in and affected by, the completion and success of a project
	2. Key in making informed decisions at every step of the project, including initiation phase
	3. Important that Stakeholders are in agreement on the goals and overall mission of the project, how it aligns to companies larger goals and mission. Make sure everyone is clear on the project goals so that you know your making the right kind of progress. 
	4. TIP: Meet with stakeholders, do active listening.

**Measure the success of a project


**Identifying stakeholders


**Scoping project tools and resources
- #ProjectCharter
	- After identifying Goals, Scope, Deliverables, Success Criteria, Stakeholders and Resources are identified. 
	- DEF: Document that clearly defines the project and its goals, outlines what is needed to accomplish them. All the details of the project. 
	- Framework for what needs to be done and communicate those details to others. Once complete, review document with key Stakeholders to move into planning stage.
